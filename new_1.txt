Shell scripting in JavaScript involves using tools like 
Node.js to write scripts that can automate tasks, manage 
system operations, or interact with various APIs and services.
Unlike traditional shell scripting languages like Bash, JavaScript 
offers the advantage of a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, 
making it easier to handle complex operations and integrate with web 
technologies. With Node.js, developers can write scripts that run on the 
server side, leveraging asynchronous capabilities to manage tasks such as
file manipulation, network requests, and process control efficiently. This 
approach not only brings the flexibility and familiarity of JavaScript to the realm of scripting but also enables the use of modern development practices and tools, bridging the gap between scripting and application development.
